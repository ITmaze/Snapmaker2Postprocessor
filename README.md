# Snapmaker2Postprocessor

## Overview
This script is a [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org) postprocessor for the CNC function of the [Snapmaker 2 A350](https://snapmaker.com) machine.

It converts [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org) internal GCODE generated by the [Path Workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Path_Workbench) into GCODE suitable for snapmaker 2 machines ([Snapmaker documentation](https://snapmaker.github.io/Documentation/gcode/G000-G001) was used even if it seems unmaintained).

Its functions cover:
- Snapmaker CNC commands
- tool change between operations (by inserting a HMI pause (M76))
- drilling (by converting G81-G83 commands)
- thumbnail generation for HMI
- rapid moves (speed is not added by FreeCAD to GCODE)

## Usage
Refer to [FreeCAD documentation](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Path_Post) to install and use this postprocessor.

## Limitations
This postprocessor has been tested on FreeCAD 0.20 shipped with python3.10.
Generated GCODE has only been tested on a Snapmaker 2 A350. It *should* work on any other Snapmaker 2 (A150, A250, A250T, A350T), and *may* work on other snapamker machines, but with no warranty.
If you encounter any bug, please open an issue. 


## Credits
Parts of this postprocessor have been inspired by the Marlin postprocessor shipped along with [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org).
